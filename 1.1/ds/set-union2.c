This technique, known as the union find heuristic, guarantees logarithmic 
height, which is reasonably efficient. But we can do even better by using a 
technique called path compression. The idea is that all nodes we visit when 
traversing up from a node to the root are in the same tree, and so they might 
as well be pointing directly at the root. We make a second pass and update their 
parent pointers, speeding up future searches involving these nodes dramatically:
